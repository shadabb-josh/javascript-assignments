//  Question - What do you think would happen if you pass an index beyond the range of the string? 
//  Or if you pass a negative index? 
//  Try it out.

// 1. Index beyound range
let name = "Shadab Shiklagar"
console.log(name[1000]); // this will print undefined

// 2. Negative Index
console.log(name[-1]); // this will also print undefined
